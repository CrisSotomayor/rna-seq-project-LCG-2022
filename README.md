# RNA-Seq Project
## Differential Expression Analysis of BRCA samples

Cristina Sotomayor Vivas (cristina@lcg.unam.mx)

This document contains the final project for the "Introduction to RNA-Seq" module, part of the Bioinformatics and Statistics II class given at LCG-UNAM in February 2022. The original class material from [Dr. Leonardo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/) can be found [here](https://lcolladotor.github.io/rnaseq_LCG-UNAM_2022/index.html).

In this project, we will use the [`recount3`](http://rna.recount.bio) R package to download RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, obtaining all the BRCA samples. We will then evaluate the quality of the downloaded data, explore the available sample attributes, select a subset of these to build a statistical model, and perform differential expression analysis.
